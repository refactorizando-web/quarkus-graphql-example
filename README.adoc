and run the next json

```shell script
   mutation CREATE {
      createBank(bank:
        {
        name: "Santander", country:"Spain"}) {
        id
        name
        country
        }
    }
```
and after that you can use the next json to get all banks, and you can choose the fields that you want in your response.
